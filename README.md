# Nmap Parser
## Overview
The Nmap parser has been made to facilitate faster reporting during penetration testing exercises. This helps the pentesters focus more on the testing aspect of their projects and reduces the cumbersome and repetitive task of making customized client reports.

This python script simply takes **XML report** generated by nmap as command line argument.
